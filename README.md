# ðŸŒƒ City Lights: A Visual & Auditory Experience

**Rooftop** is a short, non-interactive visual and auditory experience built in **Unity** for a school project. It places the viewer atop a peaceful rooftop in the middle of a lively city at night. With stylized visuals and ambient audio, the experience aims to create a calm, meditative atmosphere where players can simply exist and observe.

## ðŸŽ¥ Synopsis

You're seated alone on a rooftop in the middle of a bustling city. Soft purples, muted greens, and deep blues color the skyline around you. Tall, monolithic buildings flicker with the life of the cityâ€”windows lighting and dimming as time passes. Above, a few planes trace glowing paths through a star-filled sky. A subtle, low-frequency electronic track drifts through the space, merging with distant sounds: sirens, car horns, and the wind. A table sits nearby with a warm cup of tea, grounding you in this quiet moment of reflection.

This project is designed not to be played, but **experienced**. There are no controls, no objectivesâ€”just 7 minutes of visual and auditory immersion.
